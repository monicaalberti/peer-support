# Peer Support Programme - Website
## Monica Alberti

This is my creative submission for the Peer Support Programme Application 2025-2026.
I made the website public on the following link: [https://peer-support.onrender.com/](https://peer-support.onrender.com/).
But if you're unable to access the link, here are some instructions on how to access the website throught the GitHub repository. 

## Follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository by running the following command on your computer's Terminal or PowerShell:
`git clone https://github.com/monicaalberti/peer-support`
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (eg: Visual Studio Code).
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder where your cloned repository is.
4. Run the following commands in order:
    * `npm install` --> to install all the dependencies
    * `npm start` --> to get the website running
5. Open your browser and navigate to the URL [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the website.
And there it is!
